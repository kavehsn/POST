This repository contains a snapshot of the codes written in my thesis.

1-POST.m file is the code for the power functions of the Point-Optimal Sign-Based tests for predictive regressions
under the assumption that the errors are independently distributed.

2-PCCPOS_HPC.m is the code for the power functions of the PCC-POS tests, intended to be calculated with a high performance computing cluster. 

2(a)-Par.slurm is to be accompanied with PCCPOS_HPC.m.

2(b)-wrapperPar.m is to be accompanie with Par.slurm and PCCPOS_HPC.m.
